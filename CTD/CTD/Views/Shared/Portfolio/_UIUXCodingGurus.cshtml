			<h3>Product Description</h3>
			<p>Coding Gurus is a tech-based blogging platform focused on providing learning articles and solutions for all things that cover coding and programming. It has a community forum for users to ask questions and receive answers. This sets it apart from typical blogging platforms.</p>
			<p>Additionally, the site has an integrated AI chatbot to guide users who still have questions after going through an article.</p>

			<h3>Objective and Design Alignment</h3>
			<p>Coding Gurus was aimed to be a user-friendly platform that fosters a strong community and also offers comprehensive coding resources. As the target audience was the developer community, the design needed to appeal to them by being modern and clean.</p>

			<h3>Product/Design Challenges</h3>
			<p>The site posed a challenge with its complexity and multiple features. It needed a balance to maintain that complexity.</p>
			<p>A thoughtful design was required to ensure the integration of the forum and AI chatbot. The site also needed to create a professional and tech-forward look that would appeal to both beginner and experienced developers alike.</p>

			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<p>With these design challenges, we focused on a design that separates the platform’s crucial elements: original articles, the community forum and the AI chatbot.</p>

			<h3>Approach</h3>
			<h3>Step 1: Understanding Platform Requirements</h3>
			<p>Coding Gurus is a blend of a content-driven platform and a community-based forum. So we needed a seamless user flow. User research helped us to identify the key user journeys like reading articles, posting queries, responding to other users and interacting with the AI chatbot.</p>

			<h3>Step 2: Visual and Functional Design</h3>
			<p>To keep the design lively and tech-savvy, we opted for Mint Green (#00A76F) to balance it with neutral tones for both light and dark modes. It ensured that the color looked crisp and fresh across both themes.</p>
			<p>To align with the fresh and tech aesthetic, the “Satoshi” font was used throughout the platform.</p>

			<h3>Step 3: Integration of Community Forum and AI Chatbot</h3>
			<p>With the multiple features in the website, the design needed to be uncluttered. So we created dedicated spaces for community form, ensuring it was easily accessible.</p>
			<p>The AI chatbot was incorporated in a way that feels natural. Putting it at the end of every article gave users the chance to ask follow-up questions if needed.</p>

			<h3>Step 4: Feedback</h3>
			<p>Follow-up user testing is a good thing at the end of every design. So after conducting user testing with users from coding backgrounds, our design is ready to be launched.</p>

			<h3>Client Testimonial</h3>
			<p>We loved to work with the design team of Coding Gurus. They were professional in their work. The way they understood and created the design was perfect. They know they’re good at their work and so do I.</p>
